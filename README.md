# Postal-Loan-Tracker
*A Tkinter-based loan management system with SQLite3 integration.*

**Overview**<br />
Developed a Post Office Employee Management System using the Python programming language, utilizing Tkinter for the user interface and SQLite3 for database management. The primary objective of this project is to efficiently manage and maintain employee records within a post office, specifically focusing on the loan details of employees under the Indian postal scheme of 1981.
The project was implemented using cursors, a database object that facilitates the execution of SQL statements within Python. Specifically, a cursor object (`con.cursor()`) was utilized to perform various database operations and execute multiple functions within the application. Additionally, a PL/SQL file was imported into the Python environment to enable the implementation of advanced employee management functionalities.
